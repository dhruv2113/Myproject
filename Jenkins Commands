To allow Jenkins to execute Docker commands and scripts without manual password prompts, proper permission setup is essential. This includes granting the Jenkins user necessary privileges via the sudoers file.

Why this is needed:
By default, Jenkins runs as a limited user and cannot execute privileged commands like docker, systemctl, or shell scripts that require sudo. Without permissions, your pipeline jobs will fail or hang.

ðŸ‘‰ Below are the commands and steps to configure permissions safely:
# Add Jenkins user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins

# Allow Jenkins to run necessary commands without password
sudo visudo
jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/docker, /usr/bin/systemctl, /bin/bash

Now These Are The Shell Script Commands:-
sudo docker build -t jenkins:v1 .
sudo docker run -itd jenkins:v1
